# Low-Level Design (LLD) Learning Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my Low-Level Design (LLD) learning repository!  
This repo is a personal documentation of everything I learn through [Coder Army](https://www.youtube.com/@CoderArmy9/featured)
where the main focus is on understanding how to **think like a system designer** and build scalable, maintainable object-oriented systems.

## ðŸ“˜ What I'm Learning

Through this course, I aim to:
- Grasp core **object-oriented design principles**
- Apply **SOLID principles** and **design patterns**
- Understand how to break down a real-world problem into components
- Build systems like a **real-world engineer**, from scratch
- Learn **class design**, **object interactions**, and **modular structures**
- Learn **UML diagram** that help to give broader view
